# polyphase-sort
C++ implementation of polyphase sorting method. Based on 3 tapes, runs distributed according to Fibonacci sequence. One record consists of 5 positive floats. Records are sorted in ascending order according to their geometric mean. The program allows for adding records from user input, from file and generating random records. Useful in big database structures, where you cannot afford storing the whole file in operative memory.
